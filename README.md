Chatbot: https://chatbot-310-app.firebaseapp.com/

Topic: **Software Development Life Cycle**

Language: ``` JavaScript ```

### Why JavaScript 
JavaScript has enough to tools to build the same chatbot that we would have made with a programming langauge but JS also has other useful features. For example, it allowed us to host our website and were able to develop an aesthetic UI. Furthermore, it will be easy to implement an API later in the project development to boost our word matching and responses.

### Input Examples

## Code | Frontend

The website is a single page application developed in Vue.js with a Vuetify(UI) component gramework. This makes it easy to implmenent stylish Material Design based components.

## API | DialogFlow  

### Integration

The chatbot uses a RESTful API and calls a GET method to DialogFlow via axios. The API call occurs after the user has placed an input. The first step of the API call is sending the user's string input as the query (request). DialogFlow then processes the query and returns a string (response). The response is then sent as the chatbot's response.

### Features

#### Typo 



#### Small Talk

#### Conversations life length increase

#### Multiple variations of user input structure.


### Hosting

Google Firebase is currently hosting our [site](https://chatbot-310-app.firebaseapp.com/).

Apart from hosting, Firebase allows us easily to connect to DialogFlow since they are both maintained by Google.
