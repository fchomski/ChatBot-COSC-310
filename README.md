# ChatBot-COSC-310
Create a chatbot that discusses topics on Software Development Life Cycles.

## About the Chatbot
This chatbot is developed in JavaScript.

### Why JavaScript 
Due to the small enough scale of the project, writing it in JavaScript provides us to 
establish a website to host our chatbot. 

This chatbot is able to answer questions that are based on the Software Development Life Cycle.




### Input Examples:
Here are a few examples:

```
What is agile?
```
```
What are some incremental drawbacks?
```
```
Are there any benefits to Extreme Programming?
```

## The Code
### Frontend

The website is single page application developed in Vue.js with a Vuetify UI Framework component. This makes it easy to create 
aesthetically designed UI with modern looks. Not to mention, it gives experience with JavaScript frameworks


### Backend 

#### Search Methods
At the very core, we implmeneted a HashTable in JavaScript (thanks to freeCodeCamp) that allows us to put and get data at O(1) time. 

#### Word Search
In regards to word search,
we decided that we would have a bank of key words that would dictate the response of the chatbot
